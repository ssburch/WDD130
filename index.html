            <p>Hello! My name is Sarah Burch, and I live in Arizona. 
                I have two dogs, Stanley and Ash, and my husband and I love watching movies. 
                Fun fact: our dogs are named after the director, Stanley Kubrick, and the main character from the original 'Evil Dead' movies, Ash Williams. I have been playing guitar since I was
            six years old. I met my husband in high school in a rock band while he was working at the music store where I took lessons. I am really excited to be back in school, and look forward to 
            learning more about Software Development.
            </p>

            <p>Arizona is the 48th state in the United States, located in the western region. Arizona is home to the Grand Canyon, which is one of the 7 Natural Wonders of the World. The Sonoran Desert is also the only place where the saguaro cactus grows. The hottest temperature ever recorded in Arizona was in 1994 in Lake Havasu City where the temperature was 128 degrees!</p>
